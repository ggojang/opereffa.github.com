        <h3>Clinical Requirements</h3>

<p>The feedback to my earlier enquiry on the "top 5" clinical requirements from the openEHR clinical community generated very positive and interesting ideas, which were distilled into an appetite for an open source clinical reference application to better understand the openEHR mission. (Original post <a href="http://www.nabble.com/openEHR-in-2009-and-beyond..-a-view-of-the-way-forward-td21623065.html#a21839379">here</a> In brief the key requirements for this were..</p>

<ul>
<li>Make it open source/shared/free for all. Enable networking of community and joint working between centres</li>
<li>Aim for iterative development - starting with supporting clinicians to do simple documentation, towards decision support Archetype-Template-GUI support (to avoid handcoding everytime) Listing of available archetypes- to allow for adhoc documentation Blend of structured documentation free text support</li>
<li>Medications and Allergies - for epSOS compliance Other clinical priorities as per SOAP noting ( including investigations, results and medication prescribing)</li>
<ul>

<p>These requirements have driven the development of this first release of Opereffa.</p>

<p>When facing the question of how to further focus this early work, I thought I would introduce you to an interesting and important push from the medical profession in the NHS in the UK, aimed at improving the standards of medical records. The Royal College of Physicians in London (in conjunction with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in the UK) has recently developed a set of Clinicians guides to Medical Record Standards, available <a href="http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/clinical-standards/hiu/medical-records/Documents/Clinicians-Guide-Part-2-Standards.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please look in particular at Section Two: Hospital admission record: headings and definitions. I hope these headings will be familiar to many medical doctors internationally, as they form the basis of the medical school "clerking" that many medical students are taught.They are also related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP_note">SOAP style of clinical noting</a> We have used these headings to form the basis for the very first set of minimalist archetypes needed to support this clinical requirement in our demo application</p>

<p>I hope this starting point should at least provide a useful basis for discussion and debate as we move this important development forward.</p>
